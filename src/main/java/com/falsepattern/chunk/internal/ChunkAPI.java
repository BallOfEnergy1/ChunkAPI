 * According to section 7 of the GNU AGPL, this software comes with the following additional permissions:
 *
 * You may link this mod against proprietary code developed by Mojang Studios (Minecraft and its dependencies), as well
 * as distribute binary builds of it as part of a "Minecraft modpack" without the AGPL restrictions spreading to any other
 * files in said modpack.
 *
 * You may also develop any mods that depend on classes the API packages (`com.falsepattern.chunk.api.*`) and distribute that
 * mod under terms of your own choice. Note that this permissions does not apply to anything outside the internal package,
 * as those are internal implementations of ChunkAPI and are not meant to be used in any external mod, thus the full force
 * of the AGPL applies in such cases.
 *
 * These additional permissions get removed if you modify, extend, rename, remove, or in any other way alter
 * any part of the public API code, save data binary formats, or the network protocol in such a way that makes
 * it not perfectly compatible with the official versions of ChunkAPI.
 *
 * If you wish to make modifications to the previously mentioned features, please create a pull request on the official
 * release of ChunkAPI with full reasoning and specifications behind the requested change, and once it's merged and
 * published in an official release, your modified version may once again inherit this additional permission.
 *
 * To avoid abuse caused by upstream API changes, these permissions are valid as long as your modified version of ChunkAPI
 * is perfectly compatible with any public release of the official ChunkAPI.
